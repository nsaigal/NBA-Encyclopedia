# NBA-Encyclopedia-React-App

## Overview

This React/Django site was created as a fun project to find NBA players. It ingests player data from an API to a SQLlite database. The website displays this data and allows player filtering by categories such as height, weight, college, etc.

## Features

- The data is sorted and displayed into a table view that is scrollable to see all the data.

- Clicking on the Show Filter button slides out a tray that displays the available filters.

- Clicking on a Player Card will slide out the career stats on the right-hand side.

- Users can filter players by height, weight, college, last name, age, and active playing years.
